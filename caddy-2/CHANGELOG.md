## What‚Äôs changed

ü•≥ v1.0.0 is here, holding plenty of new stuff!

The port config has been removed, as it caused rather confusion instead of being helpful. In case you want to change ports, please do so properly via the Caddy config!

This update brings write rights to the share folder, allowing you to store log files, or use the new features.

Speaking of new features, this version holds the latest Caddy version v2.4.0, which itself brings new function, usable via this addon:

`caddy_upgrade`, when enabled, will upgrade your custom caddy binary and all included plugins, as long as the binary is in a writable location. Please note that in order to use this function, you will need an initial binary of version v2.4.0 at least!

`caddy_fmt` can prettify your Caddyfile during startup. 

Both options are optional.

Last but not least, thanks to @mdegat01 for finding a bug and the contribution!
